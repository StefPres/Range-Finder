# Range-Finder
An ultrasonic rangefinder that outputs distance to an LCD Screen
The rangefinder uses sound waves to measure distance, by measuring the time it takes for a sound wave to return, then converting this to a distance.
It displays the distance on an LCD screen in both centimeters and inches, and in testing, it has demonstrated accuracy to 1cm, with a maximum range of 200cm
